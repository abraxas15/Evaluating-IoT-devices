## Man-in-the-Middle
### Background
The reason of the attack is to figure out what information is being transfered over the internet, and how it is transfered. This informaiton could potentialy be accessed by an actor and must therefore be processed correctly to maintain integrity.

For this method of attack we would recommend a reading from Robert Heathon on how to go about sniffing the traffic of the IoT-devices; https://robertheaton.com/2019/11/21/how-to-man-in-the-middle-your-iot-devices/
