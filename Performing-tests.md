## Man-in-the-Middle
### Background
The reason of the attack is to figure out what information the IoT-devices is transfering over the internet, and how it is transfered. This informaiton could potentialy be accessed by an actor and must therefore be processed correctly to maintain integrity. It is therefore prefered that the devices themselves send the minimum required data, to work and that this data is not sensitiv to the user. For this part of the 

For this method of attack we would recommend a reading from Robert Heathon on how to go about sniffing the traffic of the IoT-devices; https://robertheaton.com/2019/11/21/how-to-man-in-the-middle-your-iot-devices/
