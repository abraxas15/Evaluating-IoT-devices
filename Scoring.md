### Scoring system

The scoring system for the framework have we based on risk analasis that is likelihood * consequence. We have altered this a bit to fit our use better. Therefore have our risk scoring gone to "Value of implementation" * "Value of consequence"
| | Value of implementation | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |
|------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | --------|
| Value of consequence  | | | | | | |
| 1 | | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | | |
| 5 | | | | | | |
