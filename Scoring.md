### Scoring system

The scoring system we choose to use for evaluating the IoT devices will be an qualitative risk-analysis matrix. We have chosen this excact method of evaluting the total som because it will lead to an easy we to also visibly show the evaluation on the different point, and the average. With this method will we be able to put in every point of the framework in to the matrix to see which point of the framework every device needs to improve. 
 Here is the qualitative risk-analysis matrix we will be using for this scoring.

The qualitative risk-analysis matrix is a diagram we have used before with sucess. A qualitative risk-analysis method of evaluating risk is not an unusal method of showing, an evaluating risk analysis. There are many reasons for this, where some of the key points are that the model identifies the key point of weakness, it shows a clear view of the secuirty status, and priorities possibility vs impact.

For our risk scoring have we chosen 'value of consequence' * 'value of implementation'. We have then concluded that every scor over 12 will be categorized as 'RED', every score under 4 as 'GREEN', and everything between as 'Yellow'. A 'GREEN' score means that there is a low risk of security in that point, a 'YELLOW' score will be a medium risk of security, and a 'RED' score is a high risk in security.
