### Scoring system

The scoring system we choose to use for evaluating the IoT devices will be an qualitative risk matrix. There is a few reasons why we have chosen this excact method of evaluting the results. Here are some important points with a risk matrix is multiple, and some of these are;
- We have used the risk matrix multiple times before with success. We find it easy to understand, and very useful.
- the matrix identifies project risks
- The matrix shows, and identifies the risk criteria without any unnecessary advanced method
- Shows every identified risk criteria in a simple and understandable way 
- We know that the risk matrix is a subjective method of evaluation, because the implementer has to give a value that they feels is correct. Therefore should also every point have an explenation on why they get the 'value of implementation.'
- With this method will we be able to put in every point of the framework in to the matrix to see which point of the framework every device needs to improve. 
 Here is the qualitative risk-analysis matrix we will be using for this scoring.

For our risk scoring have we chosen 'value of consequence' * 'value of implementation'. We have then concluded that every scor over 12 will be categorized as 'RED', every score under 4 as 'GREEN', and everything between as 'Yellow'. A 'GREEN' score means that there is a low risk of security in that point, a 'YELLOW' score will be a medium risk of security, and a 'RED' score is a high risk in security.
